## Add-to-Cart Functionality

### This project implements an add-to-cart feature with the following behaviors:
* Users can add products to the cart, but each product can only be added once. If a user tries to add the same product again, an alert will notify them.
* The cart displays both the subtotal and the total number of items.
* When a product is removed from the cart, its price is deducted from the subtotal, and the total number of items decreases accordingly.
